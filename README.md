# Concepts to understand

<b>Big O(Time Complexity):</b>
To describe the run time complexity of the function. 
Relation between the execution time and input of the function.
Examples:
<ul>
f(n) is linear, O(n)
f(n) is constant, O(1)
</ul>

<b>Big θ(Space Complexity):</b>
To describe the space(memory address) complexity of the function. Relation between the memory space and input of the function.
Rules of Thumb:
<ul>
<li>Booleans, numbers, null, undefined are O(1)</li>
<li>String, Arrays, Objects are O(n)</li>
</ul>

<b>Logarithms:</b>
Nothing but the inverse of exponential in maths. In order to say, just like multiplication and division.
Example:

<pre>
log2(8) = 3            ------------>           2 ** 3 = 8
log2(value) = exponent      ------------>     2 ** exponent = value
</pre>

<b>Algorithm:</b>
A process or set of steps to solve a certain problem.
In other terms,
<pre>
Input ---> Algorithm ---> Output
</pre>

<b>Steps to Solve Problems:</b>
<pre>
* Understand the Problem
* Explore Concrete Examples
* Break it Down
* Solve/Simplify
* Look Back and Refactor
</pre>

<b>Naive Solution:</b>
Straightforward attempt to solve solution. In some cases, might not be the best solution.

<b>Trivial Solution:</b>
Best approach to solve the problem or optimal solution.
