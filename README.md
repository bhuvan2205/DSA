# Concepts to understand

<b>Big O(Time Complexity):</b>
<p>To describe the run time complexity of the function.</p>
<p>Relation between the execution time and input of the function.</p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>f(n) is linear, O(n)</li>
<li>f(n) is constant, O(1)</li>
</ul>

<b>Big Î¸(Space Complexity):</b>
<p>To describe the space(memory address) complexity of the function. Relation between the memory space and input of the function.</p>
Rules of Thumb:
<ul>
<li>Booleans, numbers, null, undefined are O(1)</li>
<li>String, Arrays, Objects are O(n)</li>
</ul>

<b>Logarithms:</b>
<p>Nothing but the inverse of exponential in maths. In order to say, just like multiplication and division.</p>
Example:

<pre>
log2(8) = 3                 ------------>           2 ** 3 = 8
log2(value) = exponent      ------------>           2 ** exponent = value
</pre>

<b>Algorithm:</b>
<p>A process or set of steps to solve a certain problem.</p>
In other terms,
<pre>
Input ---> Algorithm ---> Output
</pre>

<b>Steps to Solve Problems:</b>
<pre>
* Understand the Problem
* Explore Concrete Examples
* Break it Down
* Solve/Simplify
* Look Back and Refactor
</pre>

<b>Naive Solution:</b>
<p>Straightforward attempt to solve solution. In some cases, might not be the best solution.</p>

<b>Trivial Solution:</b>
<p>Best approach to solve the problem or optimal solution.</p>
